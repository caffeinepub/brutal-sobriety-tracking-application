# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display the app name “BRUTAL” as prominent text on the sign-in page without changing any other sign-in content or affecting onboarding/sign-up pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a “BRUTAL” text heading on the sign-in page near the existing logo/title area, using on-brand styling.
- Make only minimal spacing adjustments necessary to fit the new heading, keeping all existing sign-in sections and behavior unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The sign-in page clearly shows the app name “BRUTAL” as a visible text heading, while everything else on the sign-in page and all onboarding/sign-up pages remains the same.
