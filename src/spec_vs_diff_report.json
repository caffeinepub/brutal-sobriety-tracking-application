  "summary": "REQ-5 is partially implemented: the sign-in page now visibly displays the app name text \"BRUTAL\" as a prominent heading on LoginPage. However, the diff also changes other sign-in page content/styling (e.g., logo sizing, headline/tagline presentation, and button label), which conflicts with the requirement/constraints to avoid altering existing sign-in content beyond minimal spacing needed to insert the name.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Do not alter or re-layout any other existing sign-in page content beyond what is necessary to insert the app name; keep all existing sign-in sections present and functionally unchanged aside from minimal spacing.",
      "reason": "LoginPage changes go beyond inserting the app name: the logo is enlarged, the title/headline/tagline styling/content formatting is modified, and the login button label is changed to \"CONTINUE\" (and related comments suggest additional alterations). This violates the \"minimal change\" constraint/AC even though the name was added.",
